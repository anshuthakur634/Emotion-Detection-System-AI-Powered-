# 🎭 Emotion Detection System (AI Powered)

A **real-time AI-based Emotion Detection & Eye Blink Monitoring System** built using **OpenCV, DeepFace, and Computer Vision techniques**. This project analyzes facial expressions from a live webcam feed, detects emotions, tracks eye blinks, and displays results through a **professional HUD-style interface**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system captures live video from a webcam, detects faces, analyzes emotions using a deep learning model, and visualizes the results in real time. Along with emotion detection, it also monitors **eye blinks** and displays **FPS, system status, and analytics panels**, making it suitable for **academic projects, AI demos, and portfolio showcases**.
